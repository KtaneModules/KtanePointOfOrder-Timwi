                    <ul>
                        <li>Welcome to this game of Mao. You joined at just the right time. We’ve already played five cards in accordance with the current rules of the game.
                        <li>You have four cards on your hand. Once you pick up your cards, you must play a valid card within 5 seconds to defuse the module.
                        <li>Playing a bad card or failing to play a card within 5 seconds will result in a strike. You will also receive four new cards.
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        To find out what the current rules of the game are, examine the cards already played and
                        determine which <em>two</em> of the following rules are active and which one is inactive:
                    </p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>Examine the first and second character
                            of the serial number. Depending on whether each is a letter or a number, the next card’s suit must be one of the following:
                            <table>

                        <li>
                            Ranks must alternate between being divisible and not divisible by
                            the alphabetic position of the fourth character of the serial number, modulo 3, plus 3.
                        <li>
                            Ranks of consecutive cards must have a difference of <var>x</var> + 2 or <var>x</var> + 3
                            (with wraparound allowed), where <var>x</var> is the alphabetic position of
                            the fifth character of the serial number, modulo 3.
                        </li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>Ranks are considered to be numbered from 1 (Ace) to 13 (King).</p>

                    <p>Only one of the four cards in front of you is valid to play under the two active rules.</p>

                        and the community figured them out. Kudos to the sharp and clever thinkers!
